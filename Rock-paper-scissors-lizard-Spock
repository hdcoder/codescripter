# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
# Player chooses rock
# Computer chooses Spock
# Computer wins!

# Player chooses Spock
# Computer chooses Spock
# Player and computer tie!

# Player chooses paper
# Computer chooses Spock
# Player wins!

# Player chooses lizard
# Computer chooses paper
# Player wins!

# Player chooses scissors
# Computer chooses lizard
# Player wins!
